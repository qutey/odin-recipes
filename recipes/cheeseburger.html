    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <div>
    <ul>  
        <li>1 hamburger bun, split </li>
        <li>⅓ pound ground beef </li>
        <li>1 pinch salt </li>
        <li>4 processed cheese singles (such as Kraft®) </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon thousand island salad dressing (such as Kraft®) </li>
        <li>1 slice tomato </li>
        <li>1 leaf lettuce </li>
        <li>1 slice onion </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Lightly toast both halves of the hamburger bun, cut sides down, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Separate beef into 2 portions and form each into a thin patty slightly larger than the bun. Lightly salt each patty and cook on one side for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip patties over and immediately place two slices of American cheese on each one. Cook until meat has reached desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the double cheeseburger in the following order: bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef patty with cheese, onion, beef patty with cheese, and top bun.
        </li>
